CPSC 4900 Group Project - Involves using a GUI that has GUI object elements within that are to be used to, in some way, generate a webpage or site.



## Idea

A user-friendly GUI that generates HTML/PHP pages with an identical style, but the contents of the page can be modified via the GUI.  The GUI assists in the organization and potentially navigation of the pages.
